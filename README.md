#Computer Science Department Quotes 2.0

New and Improved. The purpose of this repository has changed! (Pretty cool right?) 

From S.C quotes, to department wide quotes. 

Any and all quotes are welcome(within reason)! Have a bunch of quotes from a professor? Start a file for that professor and update your quotes to it! Please keep in mind that this is not ment to get any professors in trouble when updating your quotes.

P.S. please keep the quotes in a standard-ish format. So the eyeballs don't have to strain.

"Quotes inside quotations are pretty nice. Pretty easy to read too."

"Other quotes with spaces are also easier to read. Whoa."

"I assume you get the point now right?....."

Disclaimer: I won't be moderating this much. Just updates on class days.
